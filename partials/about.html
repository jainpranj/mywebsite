				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>My name is Pranjal Jain. I am a  results-oriented, customer-centric 
        technology engineer specializing in the architecture, design and 
        development of microservices, high availability infrastructure design, 
        configuration and deployment on the cloud. 
        Currently, I am a Senior Software Enginner in Liberty Mutual
        Insurance, where I design and deploy scalable microservices and 
        infrastructure to transform customerâ€™s web experience based on 
        customer-focused research and forward thinking web architecture. 

        <p> Over the last 9 years, I have worked on different phases of software
        development such as requirement analysis, designing, programming and
        unit testing. I am an expert in architecting high-volume, real-time data
        integration systems and APIs. I  am also experienced in implementing 
        database designs for handling extreme volatility utilizing a variety of 
        RDBMS and NoSQL technologies.   I am well versed in numerous security
        best practices, processes, frameworks, and regulations. I also
        have in-depth understanding of product line/process engineering, and
        Agile methodologies such as SCRUM and Kanban.
        </p>
					
        <p>  
          I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a capability 
          to work individually and in the team.  I emphasize on broadening my 
          knowledge by continuously learning new technologies and challenging 
          myself by accepting work beyond my comfort zone.
